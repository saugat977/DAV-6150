    "## Data Splitting: Training, Evaluation / Validation, and Testing Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning models should be trained and tested on distinct subsets of the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rule of thumb: set aside a substantive percentage of the available data for model testing, e.g., 20% - 35%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no \"ideal\" testing/training split. In general, the larger the amount of data, the more you can safely set aside for model testing while reducing the chance of an ineffective model being produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use __random sampling__ to create the training and testing subsets unless you are working with temporal data (e.g., time series data) whose content is sequential in nature + non-correlated with data from other temporal periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A portion of the training subset (e.g, a random sample of 5% - 10% of the training subset) should then be set aside for purposes of evaluating / validating the results of the model training process (hence the name __Evaluation__ or __Validation__ subset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- While this approach can be effective, partitioning the available training data into training and validation subsets can drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for training the model. If we have too few samples available for model training the resulting model may end up being overfit to the random samples we generate for the training and validation subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can avoid the need for the creation of a distinct evaluation / validation subset (and thereby improve the strength of our models) through the use of __cross validation__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Data Splitting via scikit-learn: An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn's __train_test_split()__ function can be used to create training and testing subsets. However, users of the function are required to first __separate the response variable for the model from the explanatory variables to be used__ for training the model. An example is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set used in the example is comprised of information related to airline flights departing from the two major airports in Houston, Texas. A summary / description of the data set can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hflights/hflights.pdf. For purposes of this brief example, let's assume we want to construct a model that predicts the arrival delay for any given flight departing from either of the two airports. Effective use of the __train_test_split()__ function will require us to first segregate the arrival delay variable from the rest of the data attributes within the data set.\n"

    "## Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation uses __resampling__ of training data to evaluate the performance of machine learning models on a limited data sample. This allows us to avoid the need for the creation of a distinct evaluation / validation subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach to cross validation works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Step 1__: Split the training data into K non-randomly sampled subsets. These subsets are referred to as \"__folds__\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Step 2__: The model performance is then trained using __K-1__ of the folds as inputs to the training process. The fold not used for model training is used to evaluate the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Step 3__: Model performance metrics are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Step 4__: A different fold is then selected for use as the validation subset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Step 5__: Repeat Steps 2 through 4 until each of the \"K\" folds has been used as the validation subset. At that point you will have trained and evaluated the model \"K\" number of times on \"K\" different subsets of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This process, referred to as \"__K-Fold Cross Validation__\" is also sometimes referred to as \"V-Fold Cross Validation\", where the letter \"V\" is  used to indicate the number of folds (instead of the letter \"K\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can automate this process using the __cross_val_score()__ function contained within the scikit-learn library:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*** __NOTE:__ The \"score\" produced by the __cross_val_score()__ function is dependent on the type of model you are attempting to cross validate. For example, when cross validating a linear regression model, the default metric produced by the __cross_val_score()__ function is __R^2__, while the default metric produced when cross validating a logistic regression model (and most classification algorithms) is __accuracy__. As such, always be certain to closely review the documentation for the __cross_val_score()__ function to ensure you understand the meaning of the metric being output by that function relative to the type of model you are working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to select an appropriate value for \"K\" ? Some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The value for \"K\" is chosen such that each train/test group of data samples is large enough to be statistically representative of the broader dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set \"K\" = 10, a value that has been found through experimentation to generally result in a model with low bias and modest variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set \"K\" = n, where n is the number of observations contained within the training data. This gives each item in the training data set an opportunity to be used as the model validation dataset. This approach is called \"__leave-one-out cross-validation__\" (LOOCV).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, \"K\" is often set to a value of 5 or 10 since these values have been shown to produce testing error rate estimates that exhibit neither high bias nor very high variance (see \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning\", page 184, James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, ISBN-13: 978-1461471370).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variations of K-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stratified Cross Validation__: In stratified cross validation we split the data into folds based on some sort of user-specified criteria. A common use of this technique is ensuring that each fold has the same proportion of observations having a given categorical value, e.g., if we have binary response variable, we ensure that each fold has a proportionaly number of samples containing each of the possible binary response values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Repeated Cross Validation__: With repeated cross validation we train perform a K-folds cross validation N number of times but use random sampling to create a new set of folds prior to each repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__**** IMPORTANT ****__: When using cross validation __you must still split your data set into training and testing subsets__. Cross validation eliminates the need to create a separate evaluation / validation subset but it __DOES NOT__ eliminate the need for a dedicated model testing subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using scikit-learn's Cross Validation Capabilities: An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn provides us with an easy-to-use cross validation capability via the __cross_val_score()__ function. To make use of it, the user must first split their data into training and testing subsets (as we did above) and select the machine learning model they believe to be appropriate for their task at hand. We continue our example from above by constructing a small linear regression model for purposes of predicting airline flight delays using the provided \"taxi out\" and \"departure delay\" variables."
