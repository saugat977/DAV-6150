    "## A Refresher: \"Observations\", \"Attributes\", \"Features\", \"Response\" Variables & \"Explanatory\" Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- In data science an __\"attribute\"__ (a.k.a., __\"feature\"__) is generally defined as a data field or variable that represents a single aspect of a broader data observation. For example, if we are recording meteorological data via a weather station, at any given point in time we might be collecting attributes such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and ambient air pressure. If we are provided with a data set comprised of rows and columns of data and each column represents a distinct variable, we generally refer to the columns as __\"attributes\"__ or __\"features\"__.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- An __\"observation\"__ represents a collections of attributes that comprise the characteristics of a single data record. For example, if we are provided with a data set comprised of many rows and columns of data, each row is considered to be a distinct \"observation\". (__NOTE__: Some scientists also refer to such collections of attributes as __\"feature vectors\"__ or __\"attribute vectors\"__).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A __\"response\" (aka \"Dependent\")__ variable is the term used to describe an attribute we plan to use as the output of a machine learning model. For example, when constructing a predictive model, the variable we are attempting to predict would identified as the __\"response\"__ variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By contrast, __\"Explanatory\" (aka \"Independent\" or \"Predictor\")__ variables are attributes we use as inputs to our machine learning models for purposes of estimating or predicting the value of a response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Semisupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Supervised Learning__: The data set used to train the machine learning model __includes__ \"labels\" that represent the actual response variable value for every given observation. Examples of machine learning algorithms that supervised learning include regression models, support vector machines, decision trees, Naive Bayes models, K-nearest neighbor models, and many neural network algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Unsupervised Learning__: The machine learning model is provided with a data set that contains no data values for the desired response variable. Examples of machine learning algorithms that enable unsupervised learning include clustering algorithms and some neural network algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Semisupervised Learning__: The data set used to train the machine learning model is __partially labeled__, i.e., some observations contain the actual data value for the desired response variable while some do not. Most semisupervised machine learning algorithms are constructed by combining supervised and unsupervised algorithms. Examples include deep belief networks (DBN's) and restricted Boltzman machines (RBM's). Semisupervised learning algorithms are beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reinforcement Learning__: Reinforcement learning is much more computationally complex than supervised or unsupervised learning. Reinforcement learning requires the implementation of an \"agent\" that can observe its environment and then initiate actions in response to what it has observed. Examples of reinforcement learning include some robotics applications that incorporate sensors and/or machine vision components. Due to time constraints, reinforcement learning systems are beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online vs. Batch Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Online__ machine learning systems can learn incrementally from a continuous stream of incoming data. Such systems are often used when the data available for model training vastly exceeds the available computing resources or when continuous homogeneous data feeds are readily available. For example, some capital markets trading algorithms are capable of accepting ongoing feeds to financial market data for purposes of enhancing / refining their predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By contrast, __batch__ machine learning systems require the inputting of all available data for purposes of model training. The focus of this course will be on machine learning algorithms that are primarily used within a batch learning context (though some can be adapted to \"online\" usage).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Based vs. Model Based Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Instance Based__ machine learning systems rely on __similarity metrics__ for purposes of generating predictions for previously unseen data observations. Examples of __instance based__ machine learning algorithms include K-nearest neighbors and K-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- By contrast, __model based__ machine learning algorithms require that we embed all of our assumptions about the problem we are trying to solve within the form of a model and then use that model to make predictions for the response variable of a previously unseen data observation."

    "## Main Challenges of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Insufficient Data__: If we lack a substantive amount of data to train a model the results may prove to be ineffective and/or wildly inaccurate when applied to previously unseen data of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Nonrepresentative Training Data__: If the data we train a model with is not representative of the actual data to which it will be applied the resulting model will likely be ineffective when applied to previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Sampling Bias__: Sampling bias occurs when we a model we have trained using a non-random sample of a population. As a result of the non-random sampling our training data underrepresents certain sub-populations of the broader population. Using such data to train a machine learning model the results will likely be a model that is ineffective when applied to data from the broader population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Sampling Noise__: If our model is trained on a data set that is too small to accurately reflect the broader population of data from which the model is to be applied, the model is likely to be ineffective when applied to previously unseen data from that broader population. Such models are said to suffer from \"sampling noise\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Poor Quality Data__: If our training data is representative but suffers from too many missing or invalid data values, the resulting model is likely to be ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Irrelevant Features__: If our training data contains attributes/features that are not \"predictive\" of our intended response variable(s), we are unlikely to achieve the implementation of an effective model. Examples of irrelevant features can include attributes such as unique identifiers and other attributes that are in no way useful for purposes of estimating the value of a response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Overfitting__: Our model is highly accurate when applied to our training data but relatively inaccurate when applied to previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Underfitting__: Our model is too \"simple\" relative to the broader population of data we intend to apply it to and as a result its output is not very useful.\n",
